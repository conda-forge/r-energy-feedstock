  summary: E-statistics (energy) tests and statistics for multivariate and univariate inference, including distance correlation, one-sample, two-sample, and multi-sample tests for comparing multivariate distributions, are implemented. Measuring and testing multivariate independence based on distance correlation, partial
    distance correlation, multivariate goodness-of-fit tests, k-groups and hierarchical clustering based on energy  distance, testing for multivariate normality, distance components (disco) for non-parametric  analysis of structured data, and other energy statistics/methods are implemented.
